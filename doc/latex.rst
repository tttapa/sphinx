Unlike :ref:`the HTML builders <html-themes>`, the ``latex`` builder does not
benefit from prepared themes. The :ref:`latex-options`, and particularly the
:ref:`latex_elements <latex_elements_confval>` variable, provides much of the
interface for customization. For example:

.. code-block:: python

   # inside conf.py
   latex_engine = 'xelatex'
   latex_elements = {
       'fontpkg': r'''
   \setmainfont{DejaVu Serif}
   \setsansfont{DejaVu Sans}
   \setmonofont{DejaVu Sans Mono}
   ''',
       'preamble': r'''
   \usepackage[titles]{tocloft}
   \cftsetpnumwidth {1.25cm}\cftsetrmarg{1.5cm}
   \setlength{\cftchapnumwidth}{0.75cm}
   \setlength{\cftsecindent}{\cftchapnumwidth}
   \setlength{\cftsecnumwidth}{1.25cm}
   ''',
       'fncychap': r'\usepackage[Bjornstrup]{fncychap}',
       'printindex': r'\footnotesize\raggedright\printindex',
   }
   latex_show_urls = 'footnote'

.. note::

   Keep in mind that backslashes must be doubled in Python string literals to
   avoid interpretation as escape sequences. Alternatively, you may use raw
   strings as is done above.

.. _latex_elements_confval:

The ``latex_elements`` configuration setting
--------------------------------------------

A dictionary that contains LaTeX snippets overriding those Sphinx usually puts
into the generated ``.tex`` files.  Its ``'sphinxsetup'`` key is described
:ref:`separately <latexsphinxsetup>`.  It allows also local configurations
inserted in generated files, via :rst:dir:`raw` directives.  For example, in
the PDF documentation this chapter is styled especially, as will be described
later.

Keys that you may want to override include:

``'papersize'``
   Paper size option of the document class (``'a4paper'`` or
   ``'letterpaper'``)

   Default: ``'letterpaper'``

``'pointsize'``
   Point size option of the document class (``'10pt'``, ``'11pt'`` or
   ``'12pt'``)

   Default: ``'10pt'``

``'pxunit'``
   The value of the ``px`` when used in image attributes ``width`` and
   ``height``. The default value is ``'0.75bp'`` which achieves
   ``96px=1in`` (in TeX ``1in = 72bp = 72.27pt``.) To obtain for
   example ``100px=1in`` use ``'0.01in'`` or ``'0.7227pt'`` (the latter
   leads to TeX computing a more precise value, due to the smaller unit
   used in the specification); for ``72px=1in``, simply use ``'1bp'``; for
   ``90px=1in``, use ``'0.8bp'`` or ``'0.803pt'``.

   Default: ``'0.75bp'``

   .. versionadded:: 1.5

``'passoptionstopackages'``
   A string which will be positioned early in the preamble, designed to
   contain ``\\PassOptionsToPackage{options}{foo}`` commands.

   .. hint::

      It may be also used for loading LaTeX packages very early in the
      preamble.  For example package ``fancybox`` is incompatible with
      being loaded via the ``'preamble'`` key, it must be loaded earlier.

   Default: ``''``

   .. versionadded:: 1.4

``'babel'``
   "babel" package inclusion, default ``'\\usepackage{babel}'`` (the
   suitable document language string is passed as class option, and
   ``english`` is used if no language.) For Japanese documents, the
   default is the empty string.

   With XeLaTeX and LuaLaTeX, Sphinx configures the LaTeX document to use
   `polyglossia`_, but one should be aware that current `babel`_ has
   improved its support for Unicode engines in recent years and for some
   languages it may make sense to prefer ``babel`` over ``polyglossia``.

   .. _`polyglossia`: https://ctan.org/pkg/polyglossia
   .. _`babel`: https://ctan.org/pkg/babel

   .. hint::

      After modifiying a core LaTeX key like this one, clean up the LaTeX
      build repertory before next PDF build, else left-over auxiliary
      files are likely to break the build.

   Default:  ``'\\usepackage{babel}'`` (``''`` for Japanese documents)

   .. versionchanged:: 1.5
      For :confval:`latex_engine` set to ``'xelatex'``, the default
      is ``'\\usepackage{polyglossia}\n\\setmainlanguage{<language>}'``.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.6
      ``'lualatex'`` uses same default setting as ``'xelatex'``

   .. versionchanged:: 1.7.6
      For French, ``xelatex`` and ``lualatex`` default to using
      ``babel``, not ``polyglossia``.

``'fontpkg'``
   Font package inclusion. The default is::

      r"""\usepackage{tgtermes}
      \usepackage{tgheros}
      \renewcommand\ttdefault{txtt}
      """

   For ``'xelatex'`` and ``'lualatex'`` however the default is to use
   the GNU FreeFont.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.2
      Defaults to ``''`` when the :confval:`language` uses the Cyrillic
      script.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0
      Incorporates some font substitution commands to help support occasional
      Greek or Cyrillic in a document using ``'pdflatex'`` engine.

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0.0

      - The font substitution commands added at ``2.0`` have been moved
        to the ``'fontsubstitution'`` key, as their presence here made
        it complicated for user to customize the value of ``'fontpkg'``.
      - The default font setting has changed: it still uses Times and
        Helvetica clones for serif and sans serif, but via better, more
        complete TeX fonts and associated LaTeX packages.  The
        monospace font has been changed to better match the Times clone.

``'fncychap'``
   Inclusion of the "fncychap" package (which makes fancy chapter titles),
   default ``'\\usepackage[Bjarne]{fncychap}'`` for English documentation
   (this option is slightly customized by Sphinx),
   ``'\\usepackage[Sonny]{fncychap}'`` for internationalized docs (because
   the "Bjarne" style uses numbers spelled out in English).  Other
   "fncychap" styles you can try are "Lenny", "Glenn", "Conny", "Rejne" and
   "Bjornstrup".  You can also set this to ``''`` to disable fncychap.

   Default: ``'\\usepackage[Bjarne]{fncychap}'`` for English documents,
   ``'\\usepackage[Sonny]{fncychap}'`` for internationalized documents, and
   ``''`` for Japanese documents.

``'preamble'``
   Additional preamble content.  One may move all needed macros into some file
   :file:`mystyle.tex.txt` of the project source repertory, and get LaTeX to
   import it at run time::

     'preamble': r'\input{mystyle.tex.txt}',
     # or, if the \ProvidesPackage LaTeX macro is used in a file mystyle.sty
     'preamble': r'\usepackage{mystyle}',

   It is then needed to set appropriately :confval:`latex_additional_files`,
   for example:

   .. code-block:: python

      latex_additional_files = ["mystyle.sty"]

   Default: ``''``

``'figure_align'``
   Latex figure float alignment. Whenever an image doesn't fit into the current
   page, it will be 'floated' into the next page but may be preceded by any
   other text.  If you don't like this behavior, use 'H' which will disable
   floating and position figures strictly in the order they appear in the
   source.

   Default: ``'htbp'`` (here, top, bottom, page)

   .. versionadded:: 1.3

``'atendofbody'``
   Additional document content (right before the indices).

   Default: ``''``

   .. versionadded:: 1.5

``'extrapackages'``
   Additional LaTeX packages.  For example:

   .. code-block:: python

       latex_elements = {
           'packages': r'\usepackage{isodate}'
       }

   The specified LaTeX packages will be loaded before
   hyperref package and packages loaded from Sphinx extensions.

   .. hint::
      If you'd like to load additional LaTeX packages after hyperref, use
      ``'preamble'`` key instead.

   Default: ``''``

   .. versionadded:: 2.3

``'footer'``
   Additional footer content (before the indices).

   Default: ``''``

   .. deprecated:: 1.5
      Use ``'atendofbody'`` key instead.

Keys that don't need to be overridden unless in special cases are:

``'extraclassoptions'``
   The default is the empty string. Example: ``'extraclassoptions':
   'openany'`` will allow chapters (for documents of the ``'manual'``
   type) to start on any page.

   Default: ``''``

   .. versionadded:: 1.2

   .. versionchanged:: 1.6
      Added this documentation.

``'maxlistdepth'``
   LaTeX allows by default at most 6 levels for nesting list and
   quote-like environments, with at most 4 enumerated lists, and 4 bullet
   lists. Setting this key for example to ``'10'`` (as a string) will
   allow up to 10 nested levels (of all sorts). Leaving it to the empty
   string means to obey the LaTeX default.

   .. warning::

      - Using this key may prove incompatible with some LaTeX packages
        or special document classes which do their own list customization.

      - The key setting is silently *ignored* if ``\usepackage{enumitem}``
        is executed inside the document preamble. Use then rather the
        dedicated commands of this LaTeX package.

   Default: ``6``

   .. versionadded:: 1.5

``'inputenc'``
   "inputenc" package inclusion.

   Default: ``'\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}'`` when using pdflatex, else
   ``''``.

   .. note::

      If using ``utf8x`` in place of ``utf8`` it is mandatory to extend the
      LaTeX preamble with suitable ``\PreloadUnicodePage{<number>}`` commands,
      as per the ``utf8x`` documentation (``texdoc ucs`` on a TeXLive based
      TeX installation).  Else, unexpected and possibly hard-to-spot problems
      (i.e. not causing a build crash) may arise in the PDF, in particular
      regarding hyperlinks.

      Even if these precautions are taken, PDF build via ``pdflatex`` engine
      may crash due to upstream LaTeX not being fully compatible with
      ``utf8x``.  For example, in certain circumstances related to
      code-blocks, or attempting to include images whose filenames contain
      Unicode characters.  Indeed, starting in 2015, upstream LaTeX with
      ``pdflatex`` engine has somewhat enhanced native support for Unicode and
      is becoming more and more incompatible with ``utf8x``.  In particular,
      since the October 2019 LaTeX release, filenames can use Unicode
      characters, and even spaces.  At Sphinx level this means e.g. that the
      :dudir:`image` and :dudir:`figure` directives are now compatible with
      such filenames for PDF via LaTeX output.  But this is broken if
      ``utf8x`` is in use.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.4.3
      Previously ``'\\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}'`` was used for all
      compilers.

``'cmappkg'``
   "cmap" package inclusion.

   Default: ``'\\usepackage{cmap}'``

   .. versionadded:: 1.2

``'fontenc'``
   Customize this from its default ``'\\usepackage[T1]{fontenc}'`` to:

   - ``'\\usepackage[X2,T1]{fontenc}'`` if you need occasional
     Cyrillic letters (физика частиц),

   - ``'\\usepackage[LGR,T1]{fontenc}'`` if you need occasional
     Greek letters (Σωματιδιακή φυσική).

   Use ``[LGR,X2,T1]`` rather if both are needed.

   .. attention::

      - Do not use this key for a :confval:`latex_engine` other than
        ``'pdflatex'``.

      - If Greek is main language, do not use this key.  Since Sphinx 2.2.1,
        ``xelatex`` will be used automatically as :confval:`latex_engine`.

      - The TeX installation may need some extra packages. For example,
        on Ubuntu xenial, packages ``texlive-lang-greek`` and ``cm-super``
        are needed for ``LGR`` to work. And ``texlive-lang-cyrillic`` and
        ``cm-super`` are needed for support of Cyrillic.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.5
      Defaults to ``'\\usepackage{fontspec}'`` when
      :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'xelatex'``.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.6
      ``'lualatex'`` uses ``fontspec`` per default like ``'xelatex'``.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0
      ``'lualatex'`` executes
      ``\defaultfontfeatures[\rmfamily,\sffamily]{}`` to disable TeX
      ligatures transforming `<<` and `>>` as escaping working with
      ``pdflatex/xelatex`` failed with ``lualatex``.

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0
      Detection of ``LGR``, ``T2A``, ``X2`` to trigger support of
      occasional Greek or Cyrillic letters (``'pdflatex'``).

   .. versionchanged:: 2.3.0
      ``'xelatex'`` executes
      ``\defaultfontfeatures[\rmfamily,\sffamily]{}`` in order to avoid
      contractions of ``--`` into en-dash or transforms of straight quotes
      into curly ones in PDF (in non-literal text paragraphs) despite
      :confval:`smartquotes` being set to ``False``.

``'fontsubstitution'``
   Ignored if ``'fontenc'`` was not configured to use ``LGR`` or ``X2`` (or
   ``T2A``).  In case ``'fontpkg'`` key is configured for usage with some
   TeX fonts known to be available in the ``LGR`` or ``X2`` encodings, set
   this one to be the empty string.  Else leave to its default.

   Ignored with :confval:`latex_engine` other than ``'pdflatex'``.

   .. versionadded:: 4.0.0

``'textgreek'``
   For the support of occasional Greek letters.

   It is ignored with ``'platex'``, ``'xelatex'`` or ``'lualatex'`` as
   :confval:`latex_engine` and defaults to either the empty string or
   to ``'\\usepackage{textalpha}'`` for ``'pdflatex'`` depending on
   whether the ``'fontenc'`` key was used with ``LGR`` or not.  Only
   expert LaTeX users may want to customize this key.

   It can also be used as ``r'\usepackage{textalpha,alphabeta}'`` to let
   ``'pdflatex'`` support Greek Unicode input in :rst:dir:`math` context.
   For example ``:math:`α``` (U+03B1) will render as :math:`\alpha`.

   Default: ``'\\usepackage{textalpha}'`` or ``''`` if ``fontenc`` does not
   include the ``LGR`` option.

   .. versionadded:: 2.0

``'geometry'``
   "geometry" package inclusion, the default definition is:

     ``'\\usepackage{geometry}'``

   with an additional ``[dvipdfm]`` for Japanese documents.
   The Sphinx LaTeX style file executes:

     ``\PassOptionsToPackage{hmargin=1in,vmargin=1in,marginpar=0.5in}{geometry}``

   which can be customized via corresponding :ref:`'sphinxsetup' options
   <latexsphinxsetup>`.

   Default: ``'\\usepackage{geometry}'`` (or
   ``'\\usepackage[dvipdfm]{geometry}'`` for Japanese documents)

   .. versionadded:: 1.5

   .. versionchanged:: 1.5.2
      ``dvipdfm`` option if :confval:`latex_engine` is ``'platex'``.

   .. versionadded:: 1.5.3
      The :ref:`'sphinxsetup' keys for the margins
      <latexsphinxsetuphmargin>`.

   .. versionchanged:: 1.5.3
      The location in the LaTeX file has been moved to after
      ``\usepackage{sphinx}`` and ``\sphinxsetup{..}``, hence also after
      insertion of ``'fontpkg'`` key. This is in order to handle the paper
      layout options in a special way for Japanese documents: the text
      width will be set to an integer multiple of the *zenkaku* width, and
      the text height to an integer multiple of the baseline. See the
      :ref:`hmargin <latexsphinxsetuphmargin>` documentation for more.

``'hyperref'``
   "hyperref" package inclusion; also loads package "hypcap" and issues
   ``\urlstyle{same}``. This is done after :file:`sphinx.sty` file is
   loaded and before executing the contents of ``'preamble'`` key.

   .. attention::

      Loading of packages "hyperref" and "hypcap" is mandatory.

   .. versionadded:: 1.5
      Previously this was done from inside :file:`sphinx.sty`.

``'maketitle'``
   "maketitle" call. Override if you want to generate a differently styled
   title page.

   .. hint::

      If the key value is set to
      ``r'\newcommand\sphinxbackoftitlepage{<Extra
      material>}\sphinxmaketitle'``, then ``<Extra material>`` will be
      typeset on back of title page (``'manual'`` docclass only).

   Default: ``'\\sphinxmaketitle'``

   .. versionchanged:: 1.8.3
      Original ``\maketitle`` from document class is not overwritten,
      hence is re-usable as part of some custom setting for this key.

   .. versionadded:: 1.8.3
      ``\sphinxbackoftitlepage`` optional macro.  It can also be defined
      inside ``'preamble'`` key rather than this one.

``'releasename'``
   Value that prefixes ``'release'`` element on title page.  As for *title* and
   *author* used in the tuples of :confval:`latex_documents`, it is inserted as
   LaTeX markup.

   Default: ``'Release'``

``'tableofcontents'``
   "tableofcontents" call. The default of ``'\\sphinxtableofcontents'`` is a
   wrapper of unmodified ``\tableofcontents``, which may itself be customized
   by user loaded packages. Override if you want to generate a different table
   of contents or put content between the title page and the TOC.

   Default: ``'\\sphinxtableofcontents'``

   .. versionchanged:: 1.5
      Previously the meaning of ``\tableofcontents`` itself was modified
      by Sphinx. This created an incompatibility with dedicated packages
      modifying it also such as "tocloft" or "etoc".

``'transition'``
   Commands used to display transitions. Override if you want to display
   transitions differently.

   Default: ``'\n\n\\bigskip\\hrule\\bigskip\n\n'``

   .. versionadded:: 1.2

   .. versionchanged:: 1.6
      Remove unneeded ``{}`` after ``\\hrule``.

``'makeindex'``
   "makeindex" call, the last thing before ``\begin{document}``. With
   ``'\\usepackage[columns=1]{idxlayout}\\makeindex'`` the index will use
   only one column. You may have to install ``idxlayout`` LaTeX package.

   Default: ``'\\makeindex'``

``'printindex'``
   "printindex" call, the last thing in the file. Override if you want to
   generate the index differently, append some content after the index, or
   change the font. As LaTeX uses two-column mode for the index it is
   often advisable to set this key to
   ``'\\footnotesize\\raggedright\\printindex'``. Or, to obtain a one-column
   index, use ``'\\def\\twocolumn[#1]{#1}\\printindex'`` (this trick may fail
   if using a custom document class; then try the ``idxlayout`` approach
   described in the documentation of the ``'makeindex'`` key).

   Default: ``'\\printindex'``

``'fvset'``
   Customization of ``fancyvrb`` LaTeX package.

   The default value is ``'\\fvset{fontsize=auto}'`` which means that the
   font size will adjust correctly if a code-block ends up in a footnote.
   You may need to modify this if you use custom fonts:
   ``'\\fvset{fontsize=\\small}'`` if the monospace font is Courier-like.

   Default: ``'\\fvset{fontsize=auto}'``

   .. versionadded:: 1.8

   .. versionchanged:: 2.0
      For ``'xelatex'`` and ``'lualatex'`` defaults to
      ``'\\fvset{fontsize=\\small}'`` as this
      is adapted to the relative widths of the FreeFont family.

   .. versionchanged:: 4.0.0
      Changed default for ``'pdflatex'``. Previously it was using
      ``'\\fvset{fontsize=\\small}'``.

   .. versionchanged:: 4.1.0
      Changed default for Chinese documents to
      ``'\\fvset{fontsize=\\small,formatcom=\\xeCJKVerbAddon}'``

Keys that are set by other options and therefore should not be overridden are:

``'docclass'``
``'classoptions'``
``'title'``
``'release'``
``'author'``


.. _latexsphinxsetup:

The ``sphinxsetup`` configuration setting
-----------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 1.5

The ``'sphinxsetup'`` key of :ref:`latex_elements <latex_elements_confval>`
provides a LaTeX-type customization interface::

   latex_elements = {
       'sphinxsetup': 'key1=value1, key2=value2, ...',
   }

It defaults to empty.  If non-empty, it will be passed as argument to the
``\sphinxsetup`` macro inside the document preamble, like this::

   \usepackage{sphinx}
   \sphinxsetup{key1=value1, key2=value2,...}

The colors used in the above are provided by the ``svgnames`` option of the
"xcolor" package::

   latex_elements = {
       'passoptionstopackages': r'\PassOptionsToPackage{svgnames}{xcolor}',
   }

It is possible to insert further uses of the ``\sphinxsetup`` LaTeX macro
directly into the body of the document, via the help of the ``raw``
directive. This chapter is styled in the PDF output using the following at the
start of the chapter (which uses keys described later in :ref:`additionalcss`)::

  .. raw:: latex

     \begingroup
     \sphinxsetup{%
         TitleColor={named}{DarkGoldenrod},
         % pre_border-width is 5.1.0 alias for verbatimborder
         pre_border-width=2pt,
         % pre_padding is 5.1.0 alias for verbatimsep
         pre_padding=5pt,
         % rounded boxes are new at 5.1.0
         pre_border-radius=5pt,
         % TeXcolor means syntax must be as for LaTeX \definecolor
         pre_background-TeXcolor={named}{OldLace},
         pre_border-TeXcolor={named}{Gold},
         %
         % 5.1.0 alias for warningborder
         div.warning_border-width=3pt,
         div.warning_padding=6pt,
         div.warning_padding-right=18pt,
         div.warning_padding-bottom=18pt,
         div.warning_border-TeXcolor={named}{DarkCyan},
         div.warning_background-TeXcolor={named}{LightCyan},
         div.warning_box-shadow=-12pt -12pt inset,
         div.warning_box-shadow-TeXcolor={named}{Cyan},
         %
         % 5.1.0 new name would be div.attention_border-width
         attentionborder=3pt,
         % same as div.attention_border-TeXcolor
         attentionBorderColor={named}{Crimson},
         % same as div.attention_background-TeXcolor
         attentionBgColor={named}{FloralWhite},
         %
         % no CSS-like names yet at 5.1.0 for note-type admonitions
         noteborder=2pt,
         noteBorderColor={named}{Olive},
         hintBorderColor={named}{LightCoral}%
     }


And this is placed at the end of the chapter source to end the scope of
the configuration::

  .. raw:: latex

     \endgroup

LaTeX syntax for boolean keys requires *lowercase* ``true`` or ``false``
e.g ``'sphinxsetup': "verbatimwrapslines=false"``.  If setting the
boolean key to ``true``, ``=true`` is optional.
Spaces around the commas and equal signs are ignored, spaces inside LaTeX
macros may be significant.
Do not use quotes to enclose values, whether numerical or strings.

``bookmarksdepth``
    Controls the depth of the collapsible bookmarks panel in the PDF.
    May be either a number (e.g. ``3``) or a LaTeX sectioning name (e.g.
    ``subsubsection``, i.e. without backslash).
    For details, refer to the ``hyperref`` LaTeX docs.

    Default: ``5``

    .. versionadded:: 4.0.0

.. _latexsphinxsetuphmargin:

``hmargin, vmargin``
    The dimensions of the horizontal (resp. vertical) margins, passed as
    ``hmargin`` (resp. ``vmargin``) option to the ``geometry`` package.
    Example::

      'sphinxsetup': 'hmargin={2in,1.5in}, vmargin={1.5in,2in}, marginpar=1in',

    Japanese documents currently accept only the one-dimension format for
    these parameters. The ``geometry`` package is then passed suitable options
    to get the text width set to an exact multiple of the *zenkaku* width, and
    the text height set to an integer multiple of the baselineskip, with the
    closest fit for the margins.

    Default: ``1in`` (equivalent to ``{1in,1in}``)

    .. hint::

       For Japanese ``'manual'`` docclass with pointsize ``11pt`` or ``12pt``,
       use the ``nomag`` extra document class option (cf.
       ``'extraclassoptions'`` key of :confval:`latex_elements`) or so-called
       TeX "true" units::

         'sphinxsetup': 'hmargin=1.5truein, vmargin=1.5truein, marginpar=5zw',

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.3

``marginpar``
    The ``\marginparwidth`` LaTeX dimension. For Japanese documents, the value
    is modified to be the closest integer multiple of the *zenkaku* width.

    Default: ``0.5in``

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.3

``verbatimwithframe``
    Boolean to specify if :rst:dir:`code-block`\ s and literal includes are
    framed. Setting it to ``false`` does not deactivate use of package
    "framed", because it is still in use for the optional background colour.

    Default: ``true``.

``verbatimwrapslines``
    Boolean to specify if long lines in :rst:dir:`code-block`\ 's contents are
    wrapped.

    If ``true``, line breaks may happen at spaces (the last space before the
    line break will be rendered using a special symbol), and at ascii
    punctuation characters (i.e. not at letters or digits). Whenever a long
    string has no break points, it is moved to next line. If its length is
    longer than the line width it will overflow.

    Default: ``true``

.. _latexsphinxsetupforcewraps:

``verbatimforcewraps``
    Boolean to specify if long lines in :rst:dir:`code-block`\ 's contents
    should be forcefully wrapped to never overflow due to long strings.

    .. note::

       It is assumed that the Pygments_ LaTeXFormatter has not been used with
       its ``texcomments`` or similar options which allow additional
       (arbitrary) LaTeX mark-up.

       Also, in case of :confval:`latex_engine` set to ``'pdflatex'``, only
       the default LaTeX handling of Unicode code points, i.e. ``utf8`` not
       ``utf8x`` is allowed.

    .. _Pygments: https://pygments.org/

    Default: ``false``

    .. versionadded:: 3.5.0

``verbatimmaxoverfull``
    A number. If an unbreakable long string has length larger than the total
    linewidth plus this number of characters, and if ``verbatimforcewraps``
    mode is on, the input line will be reset using the forceful algorithm
    which applies breakpoints at each character.

    Default: ``3``

    .. versionadded:: 3.5.0

``verbatimmaxunderfull``
    A number. If ``verbatimforcewraps`` mode applies, and if after applying
    the line wrapping at spaces and punctuation, the first part of the split
    line is lacking at least that number of characters to fill the available
    width, then the input line will be reset using the forceful algorithm.

    As the default is set to a high value, the forceful algorithm is triggered
    only in overfull case, i.e. in presence of a string longer than full
    linewidth. Set this to ``0`` to force all input lines to be hard wrapped
    at the current available linewidth::

      latex_elements = {
          'sphinxsetup': "verbatimforcewraps, verbatimmaxunderfull=0",
      }

    This can be done locally for a given code-block via the use of raw latex
    directives to insert suitable ``\sphinxsetup`` (before and after) into the
    latex file.

    Default: ``100``

    .. versionadded:: 3.5.0

``verbatimhintsturnover``
    Boolean to specify if code-blocks display "continued on next page" and
    "continued from previous page" hints in case of pagebreaks.

    Default: ``true``

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.3
    .. versionchanged:: 1.7
       the default changed from ``false`` to ``true``.

``verbatimcontinuedalign``, ``verbatimcontinuesalign``
    Horizontal position relative to the framed contents: either ``l`` (left
    aligned), ``r`` (right aligned) or ``c`` (centered).

    Default: ``r``

    .. versionadded:: 1.7

``parsedliteralwraps``
    Boolean to specify if long lines in :dudir:`parsed-literal`\ 's contents
    should wrap.

    Default: ``true``

    .. versionadded:: 1.5.2
       set this option value to ``false`` to recover former behaviour.

``inlineliteralwraps``
    Boolean to specify if line breaks are allowed inside inline literals: but
    extra potential break-points (additionally to those allowed by LaTeX at
    spaces or for hyphenation) are currently inserted only after the characters
    ``. , ; ? ! /`` and ``\``. Due to TeX internals, white space in the line
    will be stretched (or shrunk) in order to accommodate the linebreak.

    Default: ``true``

    .. versionadded:: 1.5
       set this option value to ``false`` to recover former behaviour.

    .. versionchanged:: 2.3.0
       added potential breakpoint at ``\`` characters.

``verbatimvisiblespace``
    When a long code line is split, the last space character from the source
    code line right before the linebreak location is typeset using this.

    Default: ``\textcolor{red}{\textvisiblespace}``

``verbatimcontinued``
    A LaTeX macro inserted at start of continuation code lines. Its
    (complicated...) default typesets a small red hook pointing to the right::

      \makebox[2\fontcharwd\font`\x][r]{\textcolor{red}{\tiny$\hookrightarrow$}}

    .. versionchanged:: 1.5
       The breaking of long code lines was added at 1.4.2. The default
       definition of the continuation symbol was changed at 1.5 to accommodate
       various font sizes (e.g. code-blocks can be in footnotes).

``TitleColor``
    The colour for titles (as configured via use of package "titlesec".)

    Default: ``{rgb}{0.126,0.263,0.361}``

    .. warning::

       Colours set via ``'sphinxsetup'``  must obey the syntax of the
       argument of the ``color/xcolor`` packages ``\definecolor`` command.

``InnerLinkColor``
    A colour passed to ``hyperref`` as value of ``linkcolor``  and
    ``citecolor``.

    Default: ``{rgb}{0.208,0.374,0.486}``.

``OuterLinkColor``
    A colour passed to ``hyperref`` as value of ``filecolor``, ``menucolor``,
    and ``urlcolor``.

    Default: ``{rgb}{0.216,0.439,0.388}``

``VerbatimColor``
    The background colour for :rst:dir:`code-block`\ s.

    Default: ``{rgb}{1,1,1}`` (white)

``VerbatimBorderColor``
    The frame color.

    Default: ``{rgb}{0,0,0}`` (black)

``VerbatimHighlightColor``
    The color for highlighted lines.

    Default: ``{rgb}{0.878,1,1}``

    .. versionadded:: 1.6.6

    .. note::

       Starting with this colour, and for all others following, the
       names declared to "color" or "xcolor" are prefixed with "sphinx".

``verbatimsep``
    The separation between code lines and the frame.

    Default: ``\fboxsep``

``verbatimborder``
    The width of the frame around :rst:dir:`code-block`\ s.

    Default: ``\fboxrule``

``shadowsep``
    The separation between contents and frame for :dudir:`contents` and
    :dudir:`topic` boxes.

    Default: ``5pt``

``shadowsize``
    The width of the lateral "shadow" to the right and bottom.

    Default: ``4pt``

``shadowrule``
    The width of the frame around :dudir:`topic` boxes.

    Default: ``\fboxrule``

|notebdcolors|
    The colour for the two horizontal rules used by Sphinx in LaTeX for styling
    a :dudir:`note` type admonition.

    Default: ``{rgb}{0,0,0}`` (black)

``noteborder``, ``hintborder``, ``importantborder``, ``tipborder``
    The width of the two horizontal rules.

    Default: ``0.5pt``

.. only:: not latex

       The colour for the admonition frame.

   Default: ``{rgb}{0,0,0}`` (black)

.. only:: latex

   |wgbdcolorslatex|

    LaTeX macros inserted at the start of the footnote text at bottom of page,
    after the footnote number.

    Default: ``\mbox{ }``

``BeforeFootnote``
    LaTeX macros inserted before the footnote mark. The default removes
    possible space before it (else, TeX could insert a line break there).

    Default: ``\leavevmode\unskip``

    .. versionadded:: 1.5

``HeaderFamily``
    default ``\sffamily\bfseries``. Sets the font used by headings.

.. _additionalcss:

Additional  CSS-like ``'sphinxsetup'`` keys
-------------------------------------------

.. versionadded:: 5.1.0


At ``5.1.0`` the LaTeX styling possibilities have been significantly enhanced.
Code-blocks, topic directives, and the five warning-type directives each now
possess:

- four border-widths parameters,
- four padding parameters,
- four radius parameters (only circular arcs) for the corners,
- optional shadow, with x-offset and y-offset being possibly negative,
  and the shadow possibly inset,
- colors for background, border and shadow.

All those options have been named in a CSS-like way.  Indeed, in future it is
envisioned to allow these settings to be specified either in an external file,
or in a string variable which would be parsed to extract from CSS the
selectors and properties which are understood.

Currently though this is added via a bunch of new ``'sphinxsetup'`` keys
whose names will be given now.

.. important:: Low-level LaTeX errors causing a build failure can happen if
   the input syntax is not respected.  In particular properties for colours,
   whose names end with ``TeXcolor``, must be input as for the other colour
   related options previously described, i.e. for example::

     ...<other options>
     div.warning_border-TeXcolor={rgb}{1,0,0},%
     ...<other options>

   A colon will not be accepted in place of the equal sign which is
   expected by the LaTeX syntax.
   Do not insert spaces in the input.  With the exception of the
   ``box-shadow`` all dimensional parameters expect a unique dimension
   not a space separated list of dimensions.

Options for code-blocks:

- | ``pre_border-top-width``,
  | ``pre_border-right-width``,
  | ``pre_border-bottom-width``,
  | ``pre_border-left-width``,
  | ``pre_border-width``, beware that this is a *single* dimension.  Its
    default, and the ones of the separate widths is the setting of
    ``\fboxrule`` in the preamble, i.e. normally ``0.4pt``.
- ``pre_box-decoration-break`` can be set to ``clone`` or ``slice``, default
  is ``clone`` for backwards compatibility.
- | ``pre_padding-top``,
  | ``pre_padding-right``,
  | ``pre_padding-bottom``,
  | ``pre_padding-left``,
  | ``pre_padding``, again this is a single dimension.  Its default is the
    setting of ``\fboxsep`` i.e. normally ``3pt``.
- | ``pre_border-top-left-radius``,
  | ``pre_border-top-right-radius``,
  | ``pre_border-bottom-right-radius``,
  | ``pre_border-bottom-left-radius``,
  | ``pre_border-radius``, are all single dimensions (rounded corners are
    circular arcs only), which default to ``0pt``.
- ``pre_box-shadow`` is special in so far as it may be the ``none`` keyword,
  or a single dimension
  which will be assigned to both x-offset and y-offset, or two dimensions, or
  two dimensions followed by the word ``inset``.  The x-offset and y-offset
  may be negative.  The defaults is ``none``.
- | ``pre_border-TeXcolor``,
  | ``pre_background-TeXcolor``,
  | ``pre_box-shadow-TeXcolor``.

  They must all be of the format as accepted by LaTeX ``\definecolor``.  They
  default to ``{rgb}{0,0,0}``, ``{rgb}{1,1,1}`` and ``{rgb}{0,0,0}``
  respectively.

If one of the radius parameters is positive, the separate border widths will
be ignored and only the value set by ``pre_border-width`` will be used.  Also,
if a shadow is present and is inset, the box will be rendered with straight
corners.

.. note::

   Rounded boxes are done using the pict2e_ interface to some basic PDF
   graphics operations.  If this LaTeX package can not be found the build will
   proceed and render all boxes with straight corners.

.. _pict2e: https://ctan.org/pkg/pict2e


Options for topic boxes:

- | ``div.topic_border-top-width``,
  | ``div.topic_border-right-width``,
  | ``div.topic_border-bottom-width``,
  | ``div.topic_border-left-width``,
  | ``div.topic_border-width``, beware that this is a *single* dimension.  Its
    default, and the ones of the separate widths is the setting of
    ``\fboxrule`` in the preamble, i.e. normally ``0.4pt``.
- ``div.topic_box-decoration-break`` is currently ignored.
- | ``div.topic_padding-top``,
  | ``div.topic_padding-right``,
  | ``div.topic_padding-bottom``,
  | ``div.topic_padding-left``,
  | ``div.topic_padding``,
    again this is a single dimension.  Its default is ``5pt``.
- | ``div.topic_border-top-left-radius``,
  | ``div.topic_border-top-right-radius``,
  | ``div.topic_border-bottom-right-radius``,
  | ``div.topic_border-bottom-left-radius``,
  | ``div.topic_border-radius``.

  They all are single dimensions which default to ``0pt``.
- ``div.topic_box-shadow`` defaults to ``4pt 4pt``.
- | ``div.topic_border-TeXcolor``,
  | ``div.topic_background-TeXcolor``,
  | ``div.topic_box-shadow-TeXcolor``.

  They  must all be of the format as accepted by
  LaTeX ``\definecolor``.  They default to ``{rgb}{0,0,0}``, ``{rgb}{1,1,1}``
  and ``{rgb}{0,0,0}`` respectively.

Options for ``warning`` (and similarly for  ``caution``, ``attention``,
``danger``, ``error``) directive:

- | ``div.warning_border-top-width``,
  | ``div.warning_border-right-width``,
  | ``div.warning_border-bottom-width``,
  | ``div.warning_border-left-width``,
  | ``div.warning_border-width``,
    beware that this is a *single* dimension.  Its
    default, and the ones of the separate widths is ``1pt``.
- ``div.warning_box-decoration-break`` is currently ignored.
- | ``div.warning_padding-top``,
  | ``div.warning_padding-right``,
  | ``div.warning_padding-bottom``,
  | ``div.warning_padding-left``,
  | ``div.warning_padding``, again this is a single dimension.

  .. important:: Prior to ``5.1.0`` there was no separate customizability of
     padding for warning-type boxes in PDF via LaTeX output.  The sum of
     padding and border-width (as set by ``warningborder``, now also named
     ``div.warning_border-width``) was kept to a certain constant value (and
     this limited the border-width to small values else the border could
     overlap the text contents).  This behaviour is kept as default.  Using
     the ``div.warning_padding`` key will cancel for all four paddings the
     legacy behaviour, but using only one of the four padding keys leaves the
     three other paddings behave as formerly.
- | ``div.warning_border-top-left-radius``,
  | ``div.warning_border-top-right-radius``,
  | ``div.warning_border-bottom-right-radius``,
  | ``div.warning_border-bottom-left-radius``,
  | ``div.warning_border-radius``.

  They are all single dimensions which default to ``0pt``.
- ``div.warning_box-shadow`` defaults to ``none``.
- | ``div.warning_border-TeXcolor``,
  | ``div.warning_background-TeXcolor``,
  | ``div.warning_box-shadow-TeXcolor``.

  They  must all be of the format as accepted by
  LaTeX ``\definecolor``.  They default to ``{rgb}{0,0,0}``, ``{rgb}{1,1,1}``
  and ``{rgb}{0,0,0}`` respectively.

In the above replace ``warning`` by one of ``caution``, ``attention``,
``danger``, ``error`` to style the respective directives.

The following legacy behaviour of the PDF layout is currently not
customizable:

- for code-blocks, padding and border-width and shadow (if one adds one) will
  go into the margin; the code lines remain at the same place independently of
  the values of the padding and border-width, except for being shifted
  vertically of course to not overwrite other text.

- for topic boxes and warning-type notices only the shadows will go into page
  margin, the borders are kept within the text area.

- ``contents`` and ``topic`` directive are styled the same way.

.. note::

   The ``note``-style admonition directives admit no such customization
   interface at this stage.

Here is a random example (not especially recommended!):

.. code-block::

   latex_elements = {
       'sphinxsetup': """%
   pre_background-TeXcolor={RGB}{242,242,242},% alias of VerbatimColor
   pre_border-TeXcolor={RGB}{32,32,32},%
   pre_box-decoration-break=slice,
   % pre_border-top-width=5pt,% will be ignored due to non-zero radii
   % pre_border-right-width=10pt,
   % pre_border-bottom-width=15pt,
   % pre_border-left-width=20pt,
   pre_border-width=3pt,% sets equally the four border-widths,
   %                      needed for rounded corners
   pre_border-top-left-radius=20pt,
   pre_border-top-right-radius=0pt,
   pre_border-bottom-right-radius=20pt,
   pre_border-bottom-left-radius=0pt,
   pre_box-shadow=10pt 10pt,
   pre_box-shadow-TeXcolor={RGB}{192,192,192},
   %
   div.topic_border-TeXcolor={RGB}{102,102,102},%
   div.topic_box-shadow-TeXcolor={RGB}{187,187,187},%
   div.topic_background-TeXcolor={RGB}{238,238,255},%
   div.topic_border-bottom-right-radius=10pt,%
   div.topic_border-top-right-radius=10pt,%
   div.topic_border-width=2pt,%
   div.topic_box-shadow=10pt 10pt,%
   %
   div.danger_border-width=10pt,%
   div.danger_padding=6pt,% (see Important notice above)
   div.danger_background-TeXcolor={rgb}{0.6,.8,0.8},%
   div.danger_border-TeXcolor={RGB}{64,64,64},%
   div.danger_box-shadow=-7pt 7pt,%
   div.danger_box-shadow-TeXcolor={RGB}{192,192,192},%
   div.danger_border-bottom-left-radius=15pt%
   """,
   }

In future, it is hoped to add further CSS properties such as ``font`` or
``color``.


LaTeX macros and environments
-----------------------------

The "LaTeX package" file :file:`sphinx.sty` loads various components
providing support macros (aka commands), and environments, which are used in
the mark-up produced on output from the ``latex`` builder, before conversion
to ``pdf`` via the LaTeX toolchain.  Also the "LaTeX class" files
:file:`sphinxhowto.cls` and :file:`sphinxmanual.cls` define or customize some
environments.  All of these files can be found in the latex build repertory.

Some of these provide facilities not available from pre-existing LaTeX
packages and work around LaTeX limitations with lists, table cells, verbatim
rendering, footnotes, etc...

Others simply define macros with public names to make overwriting their
defaults easy via user-added contents to the preamble.  We will survey most of
those public names here, but defaults have to be looked at in their respective
definition files.

.. hint::

   Sphinx LaTeX support code is split across multiple smaller-sized files.
   Rather than adding code to the preamble via
   `latex_elements <latex_elements_confval_>`_\ [``'preamble'``] it is
   also possible to replace entirely one of the component files of Sphinx
   LaTeX code with a custom version, simply by including a modified copy in
   the project source and adding the filename to the
   :confval:`latex_additional_files` list.  Check the LaTeX build repertory
   for the filenames and contents.

.. versionchanged:: 4.0.0
   split of :file:`sphinx.sty` into multiple smaller units, to facilitate
   customization of many aspects simultaneously.

.. _latex-macros:

Macros
~~~~~~

- Text styling commands:

  - ``\sphinxstrong``,
  - ``\sphinxbfcode``,
  - ``\sphinxemail``,
  - ``\sphinxtablecontinued``,
  - ``\sphinxtitleref``,
  - ``\sphinxmenuselection``,
  - ``\sphinxaccelerator``,
  - ``\sphinxcrossref``,
  - ``\sphinxtermref``,
  - ``\sphinxoptional``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.5
     Use of ``\sphinx`` prefixed macro names to limit possibilities of conflict
     with LaTeX packages.

- More text styling:

  - ``\sphinxstyleindexentry``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleindexextra``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleindexpageref``,
  - ``\sphinxstyletopictitle``,
  - ``\sphinxstylesidebartitle``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleothertitle``,
  - ``\sphinxstylesidebarsubtitle``,
  - ``\sphinxstyletheadfamily``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleemphasis``,

  - ``\sphinxstylestrong``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleliteralstrong``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleabbreviation``,
  - ``\sphinxstyleliteralintitle``,
  - ``\sphinxstylecodecontinued``,
  - ``\sphinxstylecodecontinues``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.5
     These macros were formerly hard-coded as non customizable ``\texttt``,
     ``\emph``, etc...

  .. versionadded:: 1.6
     ``\sphinxstyletheadfamily`` which defaults to ``\sffamily`` and allows
     multiple paragraphs in header cells of tables.

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.3
     ``\sphinxstylecodecontinued`` and ``\sphinxstylecodecontinues``.

  .. versionadded:: 3.0
     ``\sphinxkeyboard``

- ``\sphinxtableofcontents``: A wrapper (defined differently in
  :file:`sphinxhowto.cls` and in :file:`sphinxmanual.cls`) of standard
  ``\tableofcontents``.  The macro ``\sphinxtableofcontentshook`` is executed
  during its expansion right before ``\tableofcontents`` itself.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5
     Formerly, the meaning of ``\tableofcontents`` was modified by Sphinx.

  .. versionchanged:: 2.0
     Hard-coded redefinitions of ``\l@section`` and ``\l@subsection`` formerly
     done during loading of ``'manual'`` docclass are now executed later via
     ``\sphinxtableofcontentshook``.  This macro is also executed by the
     ``'howto'`` docclass, but defaults to empty with it.

- ``\sphinxmaketitle``: Used as the default setting of the ``'maketitle'``
  :confval:`latex_elements` key.
  Defined in the class files :file:`sphinxmanual.cls` and
  :file:`sphinxhowto.cls`.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.8.3
     Formerly, ``\maketitle`` from LaTeX document class was modified by
     Sphinx.

- ``\sphinxbackoftitlepage``: For ``'manual'`` docclass, and if it is
  defined, it gets executed at end of ``\sphinxmaketitle``, before the final
  ``\clearpage``.  Use either the ``'maketitle'`` key or the ``'preamble'`` key
  of :confval:`latex_elements` to add a custom definition of
  ``\sphinxbackoftitlepage``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.8.3

- ``\sphinxcite``: A wrapper of standard ``\cite`` for citation references.

Environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- A :dudir:`figure` may have an optional legend with arbitrary body
  elements: they are rendered in a ``sphinxlegend`` environment. The default
  definition issues ``\small``, and ends with ``\par``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.5.6
     Formerly, the ``\small`` was hardcoded in LaTeX writer and the ending
     ``\par`` was lacking.

- Environments associated with admonitions:

  - ``sphinxnote``,
  - ``sphinxhint``,
  - ``sphinximportant``,
  - ``sphinxtip``,
  - ``sphinxwarning``,
  - ``sphinxcaution``,
  - ``sphinxattention``,
  - ``sphinxdanger``,
  - ``sphinxerror``.

  They may be ``\renewenvironment``
  'd individually, and must then be defined with one argument (it is the heading
  of the notice, for example ``Warning:`` for :dudir:`warning` directive, if
  English is the document language). Their default definitions use either the
  *sphinxheavybox* (for the last 5 ones) or the *sphinxlightbox*
  environments, configured to use the parameters (colours, border thickness)
  specific to each type, which can be set via ``'sphinxsetup'`` string.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5
     Use of public environment names, separate customizability of the
     parameters, such as ``noteBorderColor``, ``noteborder``,
     ``warningBgColor``, ``warningBorderColor``, ``warningborder``, ...

- The :dudir:`contents` directive (with ``:local:`` option) and the
  :dudir:`topic` directive are implemented by environment ``sphinxShadowBox``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.4.2
     Former code refactored into an environment allowing page breaks.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5
     Options ``shadowsep``, ``shadowsize``,  ``shadowrule``.

- The literal blocks (via ``::`` or :rst:dir:`code-block`), are
  implemented using ``sphinxVerbatim`` environment which is a wrapper of
  ``Verbatim`` environment from package ``fancyvrb.sty``. It adds the handling
  of the top caption and the wrapping of long lines, and a frame which allows
  pagebreaks. Inside tables the used
  environment is ``sphinxVerbatimintable`` (it does not draw a frame, but
  allows a caption).

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5
     ``Verbatim`` keeps exact same meaning as in ``fancyvrb.sty`` (also
     under the name ``OriginalVerbatim``); ``sphinxVerbatimintable`` is used
     inside tables.

  .. versionadded:: 1.5
     Options ``verbatimwithframe``, ``verbatimwrapslines``,
     ``verbatimsep``, ``verbatimborder``.

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.6
     Support for ``:emphasize-lines:`` option

  .. versionadded:: 1.6.6
     Easier customizability of the formatting via exposed to user LaTeX macros
     such as ``\sphinxVerbatimHighlightLine``.

- The bibliography uses ``sphinxthebibliography`` and the Python Module index
  as well as the general index both use ``sphinxtheindex``; these environments
  are wrappers of the ``thebibliography`` and respectively ``theindex``
  environments as provided by the document class (or packages).

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5
     Formerly, the original environments were modified by Sphinx.

Miscellany
~~~~~~~~~~

- Every text paragraph in document body starts with ``\sphinxAtStartPar``.
  Currently, this is used to insert a zero width horizontal skip which
  is a trick to allow TeX hyphenation of the first word of a paragraph
  in a narrow context (like a table cell). For ``'lualatex'`` which
  does not need the trick, the ``\sphinxAtStartPar`` does nothing.

  .. versionadded:: 3.5.0

- The section, subsection, ... headings are set using  *titlesec*'s
  ``\titleformat`` command.

- For the ``'manual'`` docclass, the chapter headings can be customized using
  *fncychap*'s commands ``\ChNameVar``, ``\ChNumVar``, ``\ChTitleVar``. File
  :file:`sphinx.sty` has custom re-definitions in case of *fncychap*
  option ``Bjarne``.

  .. versionchanged:: 1.5
     Formerly, use of *fncychap* with other styles than ``Bjarne`` was
     dysfunctional.

- Docutils :dudir:`container` directives are supported in LaTeX output: to
  let a container class with name ``foo`` influence the final PDF via LaTeX,
  it is only needed to define in the preamble an environment
  ``sphinxclassfoo``.  A simple example would be:

  .. code-block:: latex

     \newenvironment{sphinxclassred}{\color{red}}{}

  Currently the class names must contain only ascii characters and avoid
  characters special to LaTeX such as ``\``.

  .. versionadded:: 4.1.0

.. hint::

   As an experimental feature, Sphinx can use user-defined template file for
   LaTeX source if you have a file named ``_templates/latex.tex_t`` in your
   project.

   Additional files ``longtable.tex_t``, ``tabulary.tex_t`` and
   ``tabular.tex_t`` can be added to ``_templates/`` to configure some aspects
   of table rendering (such as the caption position).

   .. versionadded:: 1.6
      currently all template variables are unstable and undocumented.

.. raw:: latex
